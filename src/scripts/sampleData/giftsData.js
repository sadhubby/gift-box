        message: "What a year we have went through huh? Who fucking knew the things that would happen to our friend group, the people we have lost and some people coming back. <br><br> Not to get all sappy and shit but best way to start this letter is to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. "+
        "In all honesty, with the many times we have been coursemates and whatnot, I want to say that I really love being coursemates with you. Never was there a dull moment. Maybe I have shown my gratitude in this next thing in many ways but please just remember that I thank you for being patient with me. "+
        "I am not all that smart, I simply try to work as hard as I can. You have been very patient with me in so many things and I cannot thank you enough for that. And since Grade 8, I can confidently say you have improved so much in teaching a dumbass like me. <br><br>"+
        "And like I mean, I have to give you the greatest amount and quality of flowers for being a great DM. I know I have not been the best player especially in attendance, but since Aatrox, I want you to know that you have changed a life. You changed my life and I am so fucking happy about it. DND changed my life and it was what I had as an escape back in 2022, now a hobby I know and love and I just know it would not have been possible without you.<br><br>"+
        "I wish us a great year ahead. There are many trials and tribulations but I know for a goddamn fact we are making it through no matter what. You got me by your side after all.",

        message: "Man, oh man. This has been a wild year. Second term of being sophomores then suddenly we're juniors in an instant.<br><br> I would like to start this letter with just a quick explanation of my way of life. See at this point in my life (kunware matanda) I have become very very VERY picky and choosey of whom I call friend. " +
        "I do not think I ever got to explain this to you but I explained this a lot of times with some others. Actually this kind of started frosh year but only was solidified the term we took GEUSELF together (because of CCINFOM). My own eldest kuya himself is very picky and I have come to follow suite. And the way I choose my friends is usually 1. Can they help me improve myself, 2. Can I help improve them, and 3. Do I want to grow older with them. "+
        "<br><br>Why am I saying this? Because I just want to say how grateful I am that you are part of those people I can call friend. Actually, you were technically the first since entering college life. Yeah there were some nung DLSU SHS, pero that's SHS. "+
        "You were the first person, outside of my closest friend group whom I truly harbored great respect for and whom I knew for myself I want to be friends with. Lo and behold we still are. I know for a fact that I have improved as a person with you around. I hope to every god above and the God I believe in that I have been of help to you too. I truly do wish that I can do more this coming year in being a better to you. <br><br> Thank you so much for a wonderful year Charlize. "+
        "Thank you for being unapologetically who you are. I am truly in awe in how good of a person you are. Thank you for allowing me to be part of your life. <br><br> Along with the others, those whom I have come to know through you, I wish a great year ahead and a life outside of college all together.",
        greeting: "順頌時祺",
        gift: "I actually got two gifts for you, three if I can actually do it. \n First is a spotify playlist. You can access the playlist with this link: <br><br> </b><a href=https://bit.ly/field-of-flowers>Field of Flowers</a></b> <br><br> The spotify playlist is a collection of 25 songs that which I fully recommend to you. I think given what I currently know of your music taste, you might come to like this. Some mentioned here are Jimmy Brown, a Korean RNB singer. 塞壬唱片-MSR, the fictional music company in Arknights and many more. <br><br> Your second gift is a 'coupon'. You can access the details with this link <br><br> <a href=https://bit.ly/evan-giftbox-coupon>Coupon</a>.<br><br>To avail this coupon, download the image and store it. Once you want to expend said coupon, you must send it in PM. <br><br>" +
        "Actually the third gift, the reason why I say 'If I can actually do it' is because of the magnitude of that thing that which will also be received by others. Hint: DND players"

        message: "Devon. There is no better way to kind of like start this letter, as cliche as it is, to say thank you. Thank you for coming into my life and allowing me into yours. You are well aware of my stance in like who I choose to be friends with. It is essentially pragmatic in nature but on god Devon, I know for goddamn fact that I am happy that I get to call you friend. "+
        "From what I know of, this year lang talaga tayo nagkakilalahan ng sobra and it is really fun. Like nagkakilalahan to the point that we can share vulnerabilities and struggles. Never a dull moment. In all honesty, I enjoy your company and like I guess its true that men can just know each other for a month or two then suddenly they're great friends. "+
        "Thank you for allowing me into your life. I truly do believe I have improved as a person with you. I think this was really one of those moments where we as a group just happen to click super super well. I guess there really was a path set out for all of us DB Boys to meet you and I know for a fact we all think the same that we enjoy your company. <br><br>"+
        "I wish us a great year ahead. There are more trials and tribulations to come and I am all up for it. Us as a group can and will survive anything and everything.",

Sure sounds cheesy but since those days of R6S, I know I am in good hands with you as captain. That is a fact that I still carry to this day even in real life. I know for a fact that I am in good hands, that there is for sure someone I can trust as long as you are with me. "+
        "<br><br> Miguel I truly do want to thank you for your presence in my life. I think you have pushed me talaga as a person in a sense that I am pushed to improve (*AHEM* Gangplank). I see you as an inspiration to be better and that also rings true outside of the games. I think I as a person know for a fact that if there is someone who can give me REAL ACTUAL and CRITICAL feedback on many topics, its you. "+
        "I know that if I just need that reality check, if I need that grounding presence, you are someone I can rely on. Thank you so much for allowing me to be a part of your life ever since JHS. I would not trade it for anything. "+
        "<br><br> To a wonderful year ahead. This coming year will be full of fucked up trials, that is for sure. But no matter what path we take this coming year in our college life, and even outside of college, all roads will lead back to us. ",
