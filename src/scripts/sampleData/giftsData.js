Maybe I have shown my gratitude in this next thing in many ways but please just remember that I thank you for being patient with me. "+
        "I am not all that smart, I simply try to work as hard as I can. You have been very patient with me in so many things and I cannot thank you enough for that. And since Grade 8, I can confidently say you have improved so much in teaching a dumbass like me. <br><br>"+
        "And like I mean, I have to give you the greatest amount and quality of flowers for being a great DM. I know I have not been the best player especially in attendance, but since Aatrox, I want you to know that you have changed a life. You changed my life and I am so fucking happy about it. DND changed my life and it was what I had as an escape back in 2022, now a hobby I know and love and I just know it would not have been possible without you.<br><br>"+

Second term of being sophomores then suddenly we're juniors in an instant.<br><br> I would like to start this letter with just a quick explanation of my way of life. See at this point in my life (kunware matanda) I have become very very VERY picky and choosey of whom I call friend. " +
        "I do not think I ever got to explain this to you but I explained this a lot of times with some others. Actually this kind of started frosh year but only was solidified the term we took GEUSELF together (because of CCINFOM). My own eldest kuya himself is very picky and I have come to follow suite. And the way I choose my friends is usually 1. Can they help me improve myself, 2. Can I help improve them, and 3. Do I want to grow older with them. "+
        "<br><br>Why am I saying this? Because I just want to say how grateful I am that you are part of those people I can call friend. Actually, you were technically the first since entering college life. Yeah there were some nung DLSU SHS, pero that's SHS. "+
        "You were the first person, outside of my closest friend group whom I truly harbored great respect for and whom I knew for myself I want to be friends with. Lo and behold we still are. I know for a fact that I have improved as a person with you around. I hope to every god above and the God I believe in that I have been of help to you too. I truly do wish that I can do more this coming year in being a better to you. <br><br> Thank you so much for a wonderful year Charlize. "+

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your life. <br><br> Along with the others, those whom I have come to know through you, I wish a great year ahead and a life outside of college all together.",

You can access the playlist with this link: <br><br> </b><a href=https://bit.ly/field-of-flowers>Field of Flowers</a></b> <br><br> The spotify playlist is a collection of 25 songs that which I fully recommend to you. I think given what I currently know of your music taste, you might come to like this. Some mentioned here are Jimmy Brown, a Korean RNB singer. 塞壬唱片-MSR, the fictional music company in Arknights and many more. <br><br> Your second gift is a 'coupon'. You can access the details with this link <br><br> <a href=https://bit.ly/evan-giftbox-coupon>Coupon</a>.<br><br>To avail this coupon, download the image and store it. Once you want to expend said coupon, you must send it in PM. <br><br>" +

Never a dull moment. In all honesty, I enjoy your company and like I guess its true that men can just know each other for a month or two then suddenly they're great friends. "+
        "Thank you for allowing me into your life. I truly do believe I have improved as a person with you. I think this was really one of those moments where we as a group just happen to click super super well. I guess there really was a path set out for all of us DB Boys to meet you and I know for a fact we all think the same that we enjoy your company. <br><br>"+

Sure sounds cheesy but since those days of R6S, I know I am in good hands with you as captain. That is a fact that I still carry to this day even in real life. I know for a fact that I am in good hands, that there is for sure someone I can trust as long as you are with me. "+
        "<br><br> Miguel I truly do want to thank you for your presence in my life. I think you have pushed me talaga as a person in a sense that I am pushed to improve (*AHEM* Gangplank). I see you as an inspiration to be better and that also rings true outside of the games. I think I as a person know that if there is someone who can give me REAL ACTUAL and CRITICAL feedback on many topics, its you. "+

I think of myself as super seryoso but I know with you I can get a laugh at anything and for a moment not take something seriously. I am always grateful that I have someone who can tell me to have some fun. <br><br>"+

Fortunately for me, I uninstalled league and that really took out the hangout time I could have with you. Or rather, the one with the most amount of similarity and likeliness in. On that note, its been a while since I have actually be in VC to talk about anything (again, I uninstalled league lmfao) "+
        "So I really do deem it as imperative that I first start by saying I miss you. Now comes the actual thank you because even though we don't get a lot of time together now, I still have a great hearty sea-sailor belly laugh at the times that we could in VC. Its actually amazing to me that I could just cry-laugh whenever I get to talk with you. Parang ang dali lang maging masaya. And like thats still true. Natatakot talaga ako uminom ng tubig kung kasama ka sa VC kasi alam ko mapapatawa talaga ako HAHAHAHA. "+
        "But besides that, I am grateful for also your seriousness. I think that you are someone that can be easily confided in and can give actual good and practical advice should it be needed.

        "I think out of everyone, I align with you the most in philosophy. Like I think that if there is ever someone I want to like talk about so many serious things, it would be you because I know you have the wisdom that you can partake to me. I think its a testament to years of friendship that I can can confidently say that you are someone I truly and fully align with"+

Your strength is something I constantly try to evoke. Shit has been rough yet here you are, sharing laughter with everybody. I pray for your well-being. I know this shit has been super rough for you and I may not understand fully the magnitude of everything on your shoulders. All I can give is that knowledge and comfort that you can be vulnerable with us. That comfort that you know for a damn fact that we will stay by your side and support as much as we can. It is rough, but we are here to share the burden. <br><br>"+

I've always been in awe as to how ang open mo magsalita. I think that's something I also want to emulate kasi I know it helps me and it might help others too. "+

I have someone that knows themself and me and our limits together. <br><br> But outside of school stuff, I'm happy that I get to have more time with you this year. Its really fun, especially having found that enjoyment that I had back then in wrestling. Maybe its because the Triple H era is actually so good but more than that I don't think I would have found it again if not for you. Same goes for fighting games. I think I would have not found my genuine love for competition especially for that if not for your influence. "+

I am glad that you can trust me with things even outside of class or school work. Truthfully, I like hanging out with you because of the spontaneity of which you hold yourself at. Maybe its just culture of Makati schools but I vibe with it a lot. I got to see your improvement especially in an orgnization with my own eyes and suffice to say you have been great. I am glad to be in a journey of bringing LSCS down with you.<br><br>"+

After something bad that happened with me in a course (CCINFOM LMFAO) I have become super choosy and picky of my friends. I mean I'm not getting any younger.
